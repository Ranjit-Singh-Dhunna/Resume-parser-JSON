# Universal Resume Parser: Extract Structured Data from Any Resume

## 📄 Overview

**Universal Resume Parser** is a Python-based tool that intelligently extracts structured data from resumes (PDFs) across any industry — tech, business, healthcare, education, and more. It outputs clean, categorized JSON including skills, experience, projects, contact info, and hyperlinks.

Powered by local LLMs via **Ollama** (Mistral or LLaMA 3), this parser delivers context-aware, accurate extraction.

## 🔑 Getting an OpenAI API Key

To use this project, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Here's how to get one:

1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. Sign in or create a free OpenAI account.
3. Click **"Create new secret key"**.
4. Copy the generated key — **you won’t be able to view it again later!**

Once you have your key, add it to your environment variables or config file:

```bash
